# RINA-ACC
Have not decided if rina-acc is short for rina-accessories or rina-accoutrement

## Forker beware!
Some things don't work even between Pythons locally (in-vs-out of a conda env)

### Included

**genfd.py**: **GEN**erates **F**ilename and **D**ate

**peanutbuttervibes.py**: GUI for creating posts (.md files) on local machine.  Note: Does not automatically do the git add/commit/push things (yet ðŸ¤­)

#### In beta

**almondbuttervibes.py**: Almond butter is like a fancier version of peanut butter.  Note for self: Tkinter doesn't support drag-and-drop from finder to get a file's path :(

### Ideas

OMG I can include an ASSET box in my GUI that I can copy to the public/post-assets directory.  i'm a genius this is how I can upload media (at least from desktop)

Also: Include pbvibes in $PATH so I can just run it from wherever :)

Next: Version of write-post I can write for script over SSH via iPhone
