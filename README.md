# RINA-ACC
Have not decided if rina-acc is short for rina-accessories or rina-accoutrement

### Included

**genfd.py**: **GEN**erates **F**ilename and **D**ate

**peanutbuttervibes.py**: GUI for creating posts (.md files) on local machine.  Note: Does not automatically do the git add/commit/push things (yet 🤭)

### Ideas

OMG I can include an ASSET box in my GUI that I can copy to the public/post-assets directory.  i'm a genius this is how I can upload media (at least from desktop)

Also: Include pbvibes in $PATH so I can just run it from wherever :)

Next: Version of write-post I can write for script over SSH via iPhone
